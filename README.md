##### Our project allows users to find the abortion clinics nearest them based on their location and gestational age. Our project also provides resources to the user on state-level regulations around abortion provision and abortion funds. The project currently includes Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Washington, DC and abortion providers within the Abortion Care Network (ACN).

Final Version of the annotated code for the dashboard can be found in the GitHub Repository: FinalVersion_Project4.R
